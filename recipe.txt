Grate the carrots by hand: I for one do not like using food processor for the halwa. The processor usually turns them carrots into a mush and that in turns has an effect on the final texture of the halwa.

The hand grater that I have has two sides, grate using the bigger side (with bigger holes), you don’t want the carrots very thick and you don’t want them extra thin too. 

Use whole milk: for best results, cook in whole milk. For this recipe, we first reduce the milk first to half and then add the carrots and then cook until all the milk reduces and coverts into milk solids.

You can use skimmed milk but since it has low fat, the solids won’t be enough and it’s won’t be as rich in taste.

Don’t take shortcuts: I love taking shortcuts when possible, but for this halwa which I make like once a year, I like sticking to the traditional recipe.

I grate the carrots by hand and then cook in milk until it’s reduced. Don’t use evaporated milk or condensed milk to cut short the process here for that authentic taste. 

Roast in ghee: the final bit of roasting the halwa in ghee adds a lot of flavor. It also adds a nice shine to the halwa and make it look bright red. 

So definitely don’t skip on that.

Optional- add mawa/milk powder for richer taste: I don’t add any of these since my mom never added them and that’s how it was made in my house. But adding khoya or milk powder will make it richer.
